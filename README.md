Template for NEAR dApps using Rust - Nextjs - Tailwindcss
==================

Quick Start
===========

To run this project locally:

1. Prerequisites: Make sure you've installed [Node.js] â‰¥ 12
2. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
3. Go into frontend folder and run `yarn install` to install Typescript and Tailwind.
4. Run the frontend from the frontend folder using: `yarn dev`

Exploring The Code
==================

1. The "backend" code lives in the `/contract` folder. See the README there for
   more info.
2. The frontend code lives in the `/frontend` folder.
3. Tests: there are different kinds of tests for the frontend and the smart
   contract. See `contract/README` for info about how it's tested.


Deploy
======

Every smart contract in NEAR has its [own associated account][NEAR accounts]. When you run `yarn dev`, your smart contract gets deployed to the live NEAR TestNet with a throwaway account. When you're ready to make it permanent, here's how.


Step 0: Install near-cli (optional)
-------------------------------------

[near-cli] is a command line interface (CLI) for interacting with the NEAR blockchain. It was installed to the local `node_modules` folder when you ran `yarn install`, but for best ergonomics you may want to install it globally:

    yarn install --global near-cli

Or, if you'd rather use the locally-installed version, you can prefix all `near` commands with `npx`

Ensure that it's installed with `near --version` (or `npx near --version`)


Step 1: Create an account for the contract
------------------------------------------

Each account on NEAR can have at most one contract deployed to it. If you've already created an account such as `your-name.testnet`, you can deploy your contract to `template.your-name.testnet`. Assuming you've already created an account on [NEAR Wallet], here's how to create `template.your-name.testnet`:

1. Authorize NEAR CLI, following the commands it gives you:

      near login

2. Create a subaccount (replace `YOUR-NAME` below with your actual account name):

      near create-account template.YOUR-NAME.testnet --masterAccount YOUR-NAME.testnet


Step 2: set contract name in code
---------------------------------

Modify the line in `src/config.js` that sets the account name of the contract. Set it to the account id you used above.

    const CONTRACT_NAME = process.env.CONTRACT_NAME || 'template.YOUR-NAME.testnet'


Step 3: deploy!
---------------

One command:

    yarn deploy

As you can see in `package.json`:

1. builds & deploys smart contract to NEAR TestNet
